Here's what you can expect when you stay at Picasso Suites: The Bedrooms: Sleep up to 8 guests comfortably with three bedrooms;none;We're right in the heart of the chic L'Eixample district, whose beautifully planned architecture is world-famous. Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaudí stunners like Casa Batlló, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de Música de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows). High-end shopping on the ritzy Passeig de Gracia is just a few blocks away, with Plaça de Catalunya and the famous Las Ramblas located less than 20 minutes' walk from our building.;Local permit: HUTB-005631;Whatever it is you came to see in Barcelona, I'll bet it's within easy walking distance of the house. Sagrada Familia? 13 minutes. Passeig de Gracia shopping? Right around the corner. The Gothic Quarter? Psh, you can see it from the terrace! If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepció bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about €45, or take the Aerobus to Plaça Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience. You'll be provided all the necessary key codes in advance to make your check-in seamless.;I'm an Aussie who's lived in Barcelona for almost two decades. I love making people feel at home in my adopted city, especially if it means saving you from an overpriced meal at a tourist trap. I, along with my reception team, am here for you -- unless you'd prefer us not to be! Think of us as your holiday concierge, on-call if you need a restaurant recommendation or to stash your bags for a few hours because your flight arrives or leaves at a weird time. We've got you covered.;Welcome to Barcelona! This will be your home not a hotel, make yourselves comfortable and relax. Complementary water and wine are waiting for you in the fridge. Just a couple of obvious things: - Please no pets & no smoking in the house! (€250 fine) - Please respect the neighbours and keep noise down to a minimum. - Please no drugs on the premises - Please ensure that the door is closed behind you. - Be very careful of pickpockets on the streets of Barcelona! - Check-in is from 4PM but we will always allow early check-in free of charge when possible.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21287697/fc095938_original.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21287697/fc095938_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/04ea80dbf68cdf0f25e5d5fd54f537f1;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21287697/fc095938_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;131794;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/131794;Damien;2010-05-25;Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain;"Welcome home! You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

My name is Edu. I´m originally from Madrid and in 2000 I moved to London following a dream… after going around the world for two years I finally choose Barcelona to settle down and here I have lived since 2007… I love this city and in your next trip I hope you will discover why soon.

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaudí stunners like Casa Batlló, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de Música de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows). High-end shopping on the ritzy Passeig de Gracia is just a few blocks away, with Plaça de Catalunya and the famous Las Ramblas located less than 20 minutes' walk from our building.;Local permit: HUTB-006776;Whatever it is you came to see in Barcelona, I'll bet it's within easy walking distance of the house. Sagrada Familia? 13 minutes. Passeig de Gracia shopping? Right around the corner. The Gothic Quarter? Psh, you can see it from the terrace! If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepció bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about €45, or take the Aerobus to Plaça Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience. You'll be provided all the necessary key codes in advance to make your check-in seamless.;I'm an Aussie who's lived in Barcelona for almost two decades. I love making people feel at home in my adopted city, especially if it means saving you from an overpriced meal at a tourist trap. I, along with my reception team, am here for you -- unless you'd prefer us not to be! Think of us as your holiday concierge, on-call if you need a restaurant recommendation or to stash your bags for a few hours because your flight arrives or leaves at a weird time. We've got you covered.;Welcome to Barcelona! This will be your home not a hotel, make yourselves comfortable and relax. Complementary water and wine are waiting for you in the fridge. Just a couple of obvious things: - Please no pets & no smoking in the house! (€250 fine) - Please respect the neighbours and keep noise down to a minimum. - Please no drugs on the premises - Please ensure that the door is closed behind you. - Be very careful of pickpockets on the streets of Barcelona! - Check-in is from 4PM but we will always allow early check-in free of charge when possible.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4efe470-e95e-4ef1-8ef4-b7a8ec98cc2a.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4efe470-e95e-4ef1-8ef4-b7a8ec98cc2a.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/a1ea40a637b77d3b6413e10c180481a3;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4efe470-e95e-4ef1-8ef4-b7a8ec98cc2a.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;131794;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/131794;Damien;2010-05-25;Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain;"Welcome home! You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

I discovered Airbnb originally as a guest, and I love the whole experience and ethos of Airbnb. I love how it lets you feel what it's like to really live in a place - and I love not feeling like a tourist (and not staying in tiny expensive hotel rooms!)

My flat in Antwerp is always ready for visitors. I like to keep it clean and uncluttered, such as you would expect in a good hotel space.

As the city expanded, Gracia was incorporated into Barcelona at large, but it's retained that small, intimate neighborhood feel. It's a very genuinely Catalan place; folks here take pride in where they live, and the fiestas del barrio in August are renowned for being a huge multi-day celebration. Day-to-day, there's just a ton going on here: loads of weird little shops, a mixture of both talented traditional and unique international restaurants, families, a dash of hipsters, expats, musicians... there's an older fellow who plays the clarinet outside the market that's a 2 minute walk from the place. There are plenty of bars of all shapes and sizes, but it's not a party-hard neighborhood with discos and such - more a ""let's-go-for-the-best-mojitos-in-the-world-at-the-Cuban-place"" vibe.";Like I said, I normally live here, and I'm totally in love with the place. I'm looking forward to sharing it with visitors! There's some really cool art of a blue fox on the outside door. You're gonna love it.;The location couldn't be more convenient. It's far enough away from the hustle/bustle of Plaça Catalunya that you never feel the stress of the tourist mobs, but you can easily dip your toes into it when you please after just a 10 minute metro ride (or a 20 minute gorgeous walk down the famous Passeig de Gracia). The green, blue, and yellow lines are all super close (Verdaguer and Diagonal), meaning a direct line between here and Sants if you plan on coming in by train. Taxis are easy to snag on Passeig de Gracia. There are heaps of places to rent bikes if that strikes your fancy - Barcelona is an amazing city for bikes! There are generally parking spots on the street. If not, there are parking garages nearby. You definitely won't need a car to get around, though.;"I leave my things here when I have guests in my home, but there's so much space that you won't have any issue storing what you've brought. Everything in the kitchen is yours to make use of. I'm into exercising in my home, so you'll have access to: - a TRX - a 14kg kettle bell - a rubber resistance band There is no air conditioning, but a big industrial fan keeps air circulating and keeps everything feeling pretty cool (as cool as Spain gets in the summer, anyway). It's not loud; I can easily sleep with it on. Reliable wifi internet. There are small awesome speakers that I'll leave here for your use. And, of course, there's the two-person Brazilian rainbow hammock. I can vouch that it is perfect for idyllic afternoon naps.";If you arrive while I'm still in town, I'll be more than happy to greet you at the door and give you the run-down of the place!

I am Ferran, Catalan, I come from a little village by the beach, named Calonge. I was born in Barcelona though, where I've currently settled my base. I've previously lived in cities like Madrid, Warsaw, Brussels and San Jose de Costa Rica. I studied Political Sciences and I work in a hospital. Since I was 20 I've shared a house with many people from many different places. I really enjoy home sharing and at the moment renting out the spare room helps to pay the bills, so you will contribute to a good cause :) I live on my own in the apartment, so you will enjoy a great level of privacy. I've been doing Airbnb for quite a while already, and the good reviews wouldn't have been possible without Alessandra and Sheila, my former flat-mates who initially started this experience with me. So far it's been very fulfilling and I'm looking forward to keep on hosting interesting travellers from around the world, so please be welcome!;within an hour;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18044911/profile_pic/1405276377/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18044911/profile_pic/1405276377/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;La Salut;2;2;email,phone,reviews,jumio;La Salut, Barcelona, Barcelona 08024, Spain;La Salut;la Salut;Gràcia;Barcelona;Barcelona;08024;Barcelona;Barcelona, Spain;ES;Spain;41.40935762631998;2.15470488167355;Apartment;Private room;2;1.0;1;1;Real Bed;TV,Internet,Wireless Internet,Wheelchair accessible,Kitchen,Smoking allowed,Elevator in building,Heating,Washer,Essentials,Shampoo,24-hour check-in,Hangers,Hair dryer,Iron,translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49,translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50;;30;;;;;1;0;4;7;2 days ago;;11;28;58;58;2017-04-08;123;2014-08-12;2017-04-05;97;10;10;10;10;9;10;;;strict;2;3.8;41.4093576263,2.15470488167;Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact,Requires License

You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

I work as a company lawyer, and love to do fun stuff in my free time! I love reading (Steinbeck, Milan Kundera, Ian McEwan), good food (Italian, Korean, French) visiting museums (modern contemporary but also the classic masters), doing yoga and going for a nice long run along the Amstel river. And of course I love travelling around the world - the past years I traveled through Bali, Malaysia, Thailand, California, Gran Canaria. I also love to make city trips in Europe - the past years I enjoyed the lovely cities such as Madrid, Lissabon, Rome and Stockholm. And I love to snuggle with my cat Tony (who live at my sisters place).

I want to make it possible for travelers to explore Amsterdam from a more local point of view - there is so much more in Amsterdam than the busy Damsquare, the Red Light districts and windmills... although very small, there is a lot going on in the world of art, history, there are nice and cute restaurants, cool shops and original art galleries. 

Travelling around the world, while staying at a locals place - I think its a brilliant concept. I love to travel in a relaxed way, away from the organised groups, so that I can enjoy the city or place in my own way and style. So Im looking very much forward to new Airbnb experiences! If you have any questions about me, I am happy to answer, just send me a message! :)";within a day;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4511579/profile_pic/1424520190/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4511579/profile_pic/1424520190/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Weesperbuurt en Plantage;1;1;email,phone,facebook,reviews,jumio;Weesperbuurt en Plantage, Amsterdam, North Holland 1018 TM, Netherlands;Weesperbuurt en Plantage;Centrum-Oost;;Amsterdam;North Holland;1018 TM;Amsterdam;Amsterdam, Netherlands;NL;Netherlands;52.36525878027215;4.9111727688670666;Apartment;Entire home/apt;2;1.0;1;1;Real Bed;TV,Cable TV,Internet,Wireless Internet,Kitchen,Breakfast,Buzzer/wireless intercom,Heating,Washer,Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,Hair dryer,Iron,Laptop friendly workspace,translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49,translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50;;150;799;2650;200;27;1;10;3;1125;4 weeks ago;;0;0;24;114;2017-04-02;52;2013-04-01;2016-11-22;95;10;10;10;10;10;9;;Amsterdam;moderate;1;1.07;52.3652587803,4.91117276887;Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact

You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city.

I am Ferran, Catalan, I come from a little village by the beach, named Calonge. I was born in Barcelona though, where I've currently settled my base. I've previously lived in cities like Madrid, Warsaw, Brussels and San Jose de Costa Rica. I studied Political Sciences and I work in a hospital. Since I was 20 I've shared a house with many people from many different places. I really enjoy home sharing and at the moment renting out the spare room helps to pay the bills, so you will contribute to a good cause :) I live on my own in the apartment, so you will enjoy a great level of privacy. I've been doing Airbnb for quite a while already, and the good reviews wouldn't have been possible without Alessandra and Sheila, my former flat-mates who initially started this experience with me.

I'm also a sociologist. 

I guess I can say that I've travelled considerably but, apart from Turkey, Maghreb and Japan, my trips abroad have been mainly in Europe and Latin America. I also love travelling in Spain in general and in Cataluña in particular.

I lived in Buenos Aires for two years but I missed ""the real"" tortilla de patatas badly and I came back to Spain ;-) . Instead of coming back to my hometown, Madrid, I chose Barcelona: I like the kind of anonymity and freedom that provides being an outsider although I am fully at home here. This city caught me from the very first day and now I'm deeply rooted.

I cannot live without oranges, music, my computer, one good book on my night table and my best friend. And I cannot breath properly when I'm not in the process of creating something new, from a drawing to a website. 

I love cooking. I cannot think of anything that I don't like eating although I rarely eat sweets or cakes: they are quite boring if you compare them with ham & cheese.

My favorite band is Anathema, a prog-rock band from London. I know their songs by heart. They come to Barcelona in July, there I'll be without any doubt.

It's really difficult to chose a favorite film. But let's start with The Night of the Hunter, with Robert Mitchum, and Los Amantes del Círculo Polar, by Julio Medem, among many others. My favorite series is The Wire but I cannot wait until the next Game of Thrones season, I confess. 

I am a homy person. I love staying at home. But I'm super social at the same time and I enjoy being with people who I don't know at all. I'm a Gemini, btw. That could explain it. 

Last, but not least, I'm an ""enjoyer"", which also means easy-going as a cause and consequence. But I'm quite perfectionist and a hard worker as well: I'm only tired if I cannot stand on my feet. Again, a Gemini...

It's my little landing pad as I LOVE to travel. I've always found that staying with people who live in the place you're visiting is the best way to experience a new city. 

I'm guessing around 75% of my travels have been scenarios like this and is how I experienced Shanghai, London, Hawaii, Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay, Ecuador, Spain and numerous Caribbean islands (well, I actually lived on St. Thomas for a while so that was easy to island-hop!).  Oh yeah, and I hiked the Great Wall of China in a rural mountain town where we stayed with a family...now that was amazing! Other places I've traveled include Costa Rica, Bali, Thailand, and most recently Paris. While making arrangements for a hotel or flat rental were required in some of these locations, I always look for off-the-beaten path places.  I like the little random hotels where you can throw back a beer with the owner, ya know?  I honestly can't remember the last time I stayed in a big hotel (maybe that wedding in Playa del Carmen a few years ago?).

Anyway, while my place is a rental where a guest would have the entire condo to themselves, I'm always available to make recommendations or do whatever it takes to make your visit to Austin fun.  I've hosted several bands in my condo over the years (Telephunken from Madrid, The Jefferson from Australia, and Jumbo from Mexico to name a few) and take great pleasure in making my guest's stay comfortable and memorable.

...and airbnb is recommending I give you my life motto in this little bio, so I'm going to share a couple of my favorite quotes instead:

""People say I do things different like it's something wrong"" - Bode Miller
""My only regret in life is that I did not drink more champagne"" - John Meynard Keynes
""I believe everyone is interesting if you look hard enough"" - Miranda July
""Life is the weirdest thing I've ever done"" - William West

The apartment is named after the nearby famous La Ramblas shopping street which strikes its way south 1.2 kms through this historic medieval neighbourhood. Fight your way through the crowds of people to get to the stalls to see the local produce on sale. You will be flanked by mimes, jugglers, buskers and other street theatricals not to mention the famously creative human statues. Try to avoid their gaze if you can or you will find yourself donating all your loose change. Unfortunately this cultural hub is also a magnet for pick pockets so keep your valuables out of sight at all times. Ideally visit this area as early in the day as possible to avoid the crowds.

The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepció bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about €45, or take the Aerobus to Plaça Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience. You'll be provided all the necessary key codes in advance to make your check-in seamless.;I'm an Aussie who's lived in Barcelona for almost two decades. I love making people feel at home in my adopted city, especially if it means saving you from an overpriced meal at a tourist trap. I, along with my reception team, am here for you -- unless you'd prefer us not to be! Think of us as your holiday concierge, on-call if you need a restaurant recommendation or to stash your bags for a few hours because your flight arrives or leaves at a weird time. We've got you covered.;Welcome to Barcelona! This will be your home not a hotel, make yourselves comfortable and relax. Complementary water and wine are waiting for you in the fridge. Just a couple of obvious things: - Please no pets & no smoking in the house! (€250 fine) - Please respect the neighbours and keep noise down to a minimum. - Please no drugs on the premises - Please ensure that the door is closed behind you. - Be very careful of pickpockets on the streets of Barcelona! - Check-in is from 4PM but we will always allow early check-in free of charge when possible.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21286408/9b76f413_original.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21286408/9b76f413_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/85b2552818d1a8d6120a11f150d8a619;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21286408/9b76f413_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;131794;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/131794;Damien;2010-05-25;Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain;"Welcome home! You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

Until almost half of  19th century the Plaça de Catalunya was mainly a   rural zone located outside the city walls. It was only in 1858 that the Madrid's   central government finally ordered the defensive walls to be torn down.,   approving also the construction outside the walls so a public contest was   organized in search of a  design of a new district.

The apartment is named after the nearby famous La Ramblas shopping street which strikes its way south 1.2 kms through this historic medieval neighbourhood. Fight your way through the crowds of people to get to the stalls to see the local produce on sale. You will be flanked by mimes, jugglers, buskers and other street theatricals not to mention the famously creative human statues. Try to avoid their gaze if you can or you will find yourself donating all your loose change. Unfortunately this cultural hub is also a magnet for pick pockets so keep your valuables out of sight at all times. Ideally visit this area as early in the day as possible to avoid the crowds. To the immediate east, just a few minutes away, lies the stunning Plaza Real, an architectural masterpiece where you can also find street lanterns designed by Antoni Ga;;The nearest station is Place de Catalunya a few minutes’ walk to the north.

I bit about me.. After 4 years in Barcelona, I still enjoy living in this beautiful  city every day, I´ve got lots left to explore and enjoy here. But that doesn´t mean I don´t like to change it for  a different scenery every once in a while. I am a big fan of travelling and little excursions. I started off here as a tour guide, and got to know many of the city´s more hidden spots. Originally I am from the Netherlands where I studied in Utrecht, then lived in Madrid for a while before I decided I needed the sea closer to me. 

Languages Dutch English Spanish and (some) German are no problem for me. 

I enjoy good food, wine, street photography, skiing, diving,.. and most of all spending time with good people, but hey, who doesnt ;).

The apartment is located in Palermo, the best neighborhood of Buenos Aires City.
I hope to help make your trip to Argentina a pleasant one. I was born and bred in Buenos Aires and am very familiar with most attractions and I can certainly offer assistance in procuring any kind of services
A little bit about me: I am a lawyer who loves to travel the world and live in different places. I have lived in places like Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Brussels and currently in Amsterdam. When I travel I like to walk a lot and discover the cities walking or biking. Maybe that's why I love Buenos Aires so much since you can do that very well here, and listen, my apartment is in the heart of the city so even if you don't like to walk so much, you have it all steps away!
Please feel free to contact me anytime If you have any question, I would be happy to answer to you.
I appreciate the AirBnB community!

The apartment is named after the nearby famous La Ramblas shopping street which strikes its way south 1.2 kms through this historic medieval neighbourhood. Fight your way through the crowds of people to get to the stalls to see the local produce on sale. You will be flanked by mimes, jugglers, buskers and other street theatricals not to mention the famously creative human statues. Try to avoid their gaze if you can or you will find yourself donating all your loose change. Unfortunately this cultural hub is also a magnet for pick pockets so keep your valuables out of sight at all times. Ideally visit this area as early in the day as possible to avoid the crowds. To the immediate east, just a few minutes away, lies the stunning Plaza Real, an architectural masterpiece where you can also find street lanterns designed by Antoni Ga;;The nearest station is Place de Catalunya a few minutes’ walk to the north. Alternatively head south along La Ramblas to Liceu metro station. It takes around 7 minutes on foot although it could be longer if you are intercepted by the human statues!;;;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f7395fcb-5b24-456f-96a8-d04a8fa139a3.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f7395fcb-5b24-456f-96a8-d04a8fa139a3.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/1448ed7f2bb133a8347751bc781dba80;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f7395fcb-5b24-456f-96a8-d04a8fa139a3.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;54310958;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/54310958;Javier;2016-01-12;Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain;"Be Mate offers the exclusive City Mate service, a local concierge that will welcome you to the apartment and will assist you before, during and after your stay with everything you may need.
