Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaud√≠ stunners like Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de M√∫sica de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows).

If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepci√≥ bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about ‚Ç¨45, or take the Aerobus to Pla√ßa Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience.

You could call me a globetrotter - I‚Äôve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren‚Äôt just a place to lay your head...they‚Äôre your next home-away-from-home.

I like to enjoy life...a glass of wine on a terrace by the beach...a stroll  through the hills closeby...I don¬¥t like to rush things and enjoy savouring those moments that we too often take for granted.";within a day;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11086217/profile_pic/1389104615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11086217/profile_pic/1389104615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample;2;2;email,phone,reviews,jumio;L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia 08011, Spain;L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample;l'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample;Eixample;Barcelona;Catalonia;08011;Barcelona;Barcelona, Spain;ES;Spain;41.389762945459246;2.157903591335274;Apartment;Private room;2;1.0;1;1;Real Bed;TV,Internet,Wireless Internet,Air conditioning,Kitchen,Smoking allowed,Elevator in building,Buzzer/wireless intercom,Heating,Dryer,Essentials,Shampoo;;30;;;84;;1;5;3;180;today;;4;6;11;140;2017-04-08;74;2014-10-31;2017-04-03;98;10;10;10;10;10;10;;;moderate;2;2.49;41.3897629455,2.15790359134;Host Is Superhost,Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact,Requires License

This area might be not available at some times of the day or night, this depends on my rest and rehearsing times but as long as the door is wide open everybody's welcome to have breakfast or smoke in the balcony (In case of being closed there is always the kitchen fully equipped where everybody can eat).

As the city expanded, Gracia was incorporated into Barcelona at large, but it's retained that small, intimate neighborhood feel. It's a very genuinely Catalan place; folks here take pride in where they live, and the fiestas del barrio in August are renowned for being a huge multi-day celebration. Day-to-day, there's just a ton going on here: loads of weird little shops, a mixture of both talented traditional and unique international restaurants, families, a dash of hipsters, expats, musicians... there's an older fellow who plays the clarinet outside the market that's a 2 minute walk from the place. There are plenty of bars of all shapes and sizes, but it's not a party-hard neighborhood with discos and such - more a ""let's-go-for-the-best-mojitos-in-the-world-at-the-Cuban-place"" vibe.";Like I said, I normally live here, and I'm totally in love with the place. I'm looking forward to sharing it with visitors! There's some really cool art of a blue fox on the outside door. You're gonna love it.;The location couldn't be more convenient. It's far enough away from the hustle/bustle of Pla√ßa Catalunya that you never feel the stress of the tourist mobs, but you can easily dip your toes into it when you please after just a 10 minute metro ride (or a 20 minute gorgeous walk down the famous Passeig de Gracia). The green, blue, and yellow lines are all super close (Verdaguer and Diagonal), meaning a direct line between here and Sants if you plan on coming in by train. Taxis are easy to snag on Passeig de Gracia. There are heaps of places to rent bikes if that strikes your fancy - Barcelona is an amazing city for bikes! There are generally parking spots on the street. If not, there are parking garages nearby. You definitely won't need a car to get around, though.;"I leave my things here when I have guests in my home, but there's so much space that you won't have any issue storing what you've brought. Everything in the kitchen is yours to make use of. I'm into exercising in my home, so you'll have access to: - a TRX - a 14kg kettle bell - a rubber resistance band There is no air conditioning, but a big industrial fan keeps air circulating and keeps everything feeling pretty cool (as cool as Spain gets in the summer, anyway). It's not loud; I can easily sleep with it on. Reliable wifi internet. There are small awesome speakers that I'll leave here for your use. And, of course, there's the two-person Brazilian rainbow hammock. I can vouch that it is perfect for idyllic afternoon naps.";If you arrive while I'm still in town, I'll be more than happy to greet you at the door and give you the run-down of the place!

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaud√≠ stunners like Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de M√∫sica de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows).

The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepci√≥ bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about ‚Ç¨45, or take the Aerobus to Pla√ßa Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience.

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaud√≠ stunners like Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de M√∫sica de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows).

You could call me a globetrotter - I‚Äôve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren‚Äôt just a place to lay your head...they‚Äôre your next home-away-from-home.

I work as a company lawyer, and love to do fun stuff in my free time! I love reading (Steinbeck, Milan Kundera, Ian McEwan), good food (Italian, Korean, French) visiting museums (modern contemporary but also the classic masters), doing yoga and going for a nice long run along the Amstel river. And of course I love travelling around the world - the past years I traveled through Bali, Malaysia, Thailand, California, Gran Canaria. I also love to make city trips in Europe - the past years I enjoyed the lovely cities such as Madrid, Lissabon, Rome and Stockholm. And I love to snuggle with my cat Tony (who live at my sisters place).

I want to make it possible for travelers to explore Amsterdam from a more local point of view - there is so much more in Amsterdam than the busy Damsquare, the Red Light districts and windmills... although very small, there is a lot going on in the world of art, history, there are nice and cute restaurants, cool shops and original art galleries. 

Travelling around the world, while staying at a locals place - I think its a brilliant concept. I love to travel in a relaxed way, away from the organised groups, so that I can enjoy the city or place in my own way and style. So Im looking very much forward to new Airbnb experiences!

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaud√≠ stunners like Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de M√∫sica de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows). High-end shopping on the ritzy Passeig de Gracia is just a few blocks away, with Pla√ßa de Catalunya and the famous Las Ramblas located less than 20 minutes' walk from our building.;Local permit: HUTB-006791;Whatever it is you came to see in Barcelona, I'll bet it's within easy walking distance of the house. Sagrada Familia? 13 minutes. Passeig de Gracia shopping? Right around the corner. The Gothic Quarter? Psh, you can see it from the terrace! If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepci√≥ bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about ‚Ç¨45, or take the Aerobus to Pla√ßa Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience. You'll be provided all the necessary key codes in advance to make your check-in seamless.;I'm an Aussie who's lived in Barcelona for almost two decades. I love making people feel at home in my adopted city, especially if it means saving you from an overpriced meal at a tourist trap. I, along with my reception team, am here for you -- unless you'd prefer us not to be! Think of us as your holiday concierge, on-call if you need a restaurant recommendation or to stash your bags for a few hours because your flight arrives or leaves at a weird time. We've got you covered.;Welcome to Barcelona! This will be your home not a hotel, make yourselves comfortable and relax. Complementary water and wine are waiting for you in the fridge. Just a couple of obvious things: - Please no pets & no smoking in the house! (‚Ç¨250 fine) - Please respect the neighbours and keep noise down to a minimum. - Please no drugs on the premises - Please ensure that the door is closed behind you. - Be very careful of pickpockets on the streets of Barcelona! - Check-in is from 4PM but we will always allow early check-in free of charge when possible.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/184daba8-0911-4d3b-92c2-1166d9e2b71d.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/184daba8-0911-4d3b-92c2-1166d9e2b71d.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/70675fd713ea0aa2170ee57182a292d7;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/184daba8-0911-4d3b-92c2-1166d9e2b71d.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;131794;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/131794;Damien;2010-05-25;Barcelona, Catalu√±a, Spain;"Welcome home! You could call me a globetrotter - I‚Äôve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps!

I've been doing Airbnb for quite a while already, and the good reviews wouldn't have been possible without Alessandra and Sheila, my former flat-mates who initially started this experience with me. So far it's been very fulfilling and I'm looking forward to keep on hosting interesting travellers from around the world, so please be welcome!;within an hour;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18044911/profile_pic/1405276377/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18044911/profile_pic/1405276377/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;La Salut;2;2;email,phone,reviews,jumio;La Salut, Barcelona, Catalunya 08024, Spain;La Salut;la Salut;Gr√†cia;Barcelona;Catalunya;08024;Barcelona;Barcelona, Spain;ES;Spain;41.412262174111085;2.158687096067717;Apartment;Private room;1;1.0;1;1;Real Bed;Internet,Wireless Internet,Wheelchair accessible,Kitchen,Smoking allowed,Doorman,Elevator in building,Buzzer/wireless intercom,Heating,Essentials,Shampoo,24-hour check-in,Hangers,Hair dryer,Iron;;20;;;;;1;15;4;7;2 days ago;;7;30;60;60;2017-04-08;6;2015-12-08;2017-01-31;97;10;10;10;10;9;9;;;strict;2;0.37;41.4122621741,2.15868709607;Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact,Requires License

I'm also a sociologist. 

I guess I can say that I've travelled considerably but, apart from Turkey, Maghreb and Japan, my trips abroad have been mainly in Europe and Latin America. I also love travelling in Spain in general and in Catalu√±a in particular.

I lived in Buenos Aires for two years but I missed ""the real"" tortilla de patatas badly and I came back to Spain ;-) . Instead of coming back to my hometown, Madrid, I chose Barcelona: I like the kind of anonymity and freedom that provides being an outsider although I am fully at home here. This city caught me from the very first day and now I'm deeply rooted.

I cannot live without oranges, music, my computer, one good book on my night table and my best friend. And I cannot breath properly when I'm not in the process of creating something new, from a drawing to a website. 

I love cooking. I cannot think of anything that I don't like eating although I rarely eat sweets or cakes: they are quite boring if you compare them with ham & cheese.

My favorite band is Anathema, a prog-rock band from London. I know their songs by heart. They come to Barcelona in July, there I'll be without any doubt.

It's really difficult to chose a favorite film. But let's start with The Night of the Hunter, with Robert Mitchum, and Los Amantes del C√≠rculo Polar, by Julio Medem, among many others. My favorite series is The Wire but I cannot wait until the next Game of Thrones season, I confess. 

I am a homy person. I love staying at home. But I'm super social at the same time and I enjoy being with people who I don't know at all. I'm a Gemini, btw. That could explain it. 

Last, but not least, I'm an ""enjoyer"", which also means easy-going as a cause and consequence. But I'm quite perfectionist and a hard worker as well: I'm only tired if I cannot stand on my feet. Again, a Gemini...

It's my little landing pad as I LOVE to travel. I've always found that staying with people who live in the place you're visiting is the best way to experience a new city. 

I'm guessing around 75% of my travels have been scenarios like this and is how I experienced Shanghai, London, Hawaii, Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay, Ecuador, Spain and numerous Caribbean islands (well, I actually lived on St. Thomas for a while so that was easy to island-hop!).  Oh yeah, and I hiked the Great Wall of China in a rural mountain town where we stayed with a family...now that was amazing! Other places I've traveled include Costa Rica, Bali, Thailand, and most recently Paris. While making arrangements for a hotel or flat rental were required in some of these locations, I always look for off-the-beaten path places.  I like the little random hotels where you can throw back a beer with the owner, ya know?  I honestly can't remember the last time I stayed in a big hotel (maybe that wedding in Playa del Carmen a few years ago?).

Anyway, while my place is a rental where a guest would have the entire condo to themselves, I'm always available to make recommendations or do whatever it takes to make your visit to Austin fun.  I've hosted several bands in my condo over the years (Telephunken from Madrid, The Jefferson from Australia, and Jumbo from Mexico to name a few) and take great pleasure in making my guest's stay comfortable and memorable.

...and airbnb is recommending I give you my life motto in this little bio, so I'm going to share a couple of my favorite quotes instead:

""People say I do things different like it's something wrong"" - Bode Miller
""My only regret in life is that I did not drink more champagne"" - John Meynard Keynes
""I believe everyone is interesting if you look hard enough"" - Miranda July
""Life is the weirdest thing I've ever done"" - William West

In recent years, it has been reinvented to become an emblematic, must-visit place for Barcelona residents and tourists alike, an integral part of urban life in the city. Everything is possible here: walking, sport, shopping, eating in restaurants and hotels next to the sea, visiting museums‚Ä¶At Barceloneta/Borne you can go shopping 365 days a year, eat in restaurants close to the sea, visit museums, go to the cinema, see marine species, take a boat trip, take the cable car, do sport, and much more.

Here you will find cycle lanes, open-air markets, terraces, bars‚Ä¶ It will surprise you!;Winter in the Boat: Even the winter in Barcelona is quite soft, nights can be cold, but with the heating of the boat you will feel perfectly;"It forms part of Olympic Village's attractive sea front, set in the heart of Barcelona's maritime zone and surrounded by beaches, gardens and buildings as prominent as the Torre Mapfre and the Hotel Arts, being what might be classed as an ""Urban Port"" thanks to its easy access from all locations, including public transport such as the underground (Line 4 CIUDADELA) and several buses (lines 36, 45, 59 and 71) which serve Port Ol√≠mpic.";;;The Alexandrea IV deserves some respect, as it is an old ship. It's like living in a house, but a ship requires some extra care. The rules are listed in a separate document you will receive after booking. Most important to know up-front is the sanitary pump. This can only handle (waste) water . Anything else, e.g. toilet paper, baby lotion swaps, etc will very likely block the pump, there is a can on the Toilet where you can throw the papers.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20098866/b44fe1a8_original.jpg?aki_policy=small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20098866/b44fe1a8_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium;https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/airbnb-listings/files/9459ff1d97cede02b16e9a03df893ff9;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20098866/b44fe1a8_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large;7238727;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/7238727;I√±igo;2013-07-02;Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain;Me gusta la arquitectura, la fotograf√≠a, la pintura, el cine, navegar;within an hour;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7238727/profile_pic/1372778976/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7238727/profile_pic/1372778976/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;La Vila Ol√≠mpica;1;1;email,phone,reviews,jumio;La Vila Ol√≠mpica, Barcelona, Catalonia 08005, Spain;La Vila Ol√≠mpica;la Vila Ol√≠mpica del Poblenou;Sant Mart√≠;Barcelona;Catalonia;08005;Barcelona;Barcelona, Spain;ES;Spain;41.38773930859441;2.196723939727627;Boat;Entire home/apt;3;1.0;2;2;Real Bed;TV,Kitchen,Heating,Family/kid friendly,Carbon monoxide detector,Fire extinguisher,Essentials,Shampoo,24-hour check-in,Hangers,Hair dryer,Iron,Laptop friendly workspace;;95;;;300;60;1;0;3;1125;2 weeks ago;;3;9;13;248;2017-04-08;79;2013-09-01;2017-01-01;92;9;9;9;10;9;9;;;moderate;1;1.8;41.3877393086,2.19672393973;Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact,Requires License,Instant Bookable

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaud√≠ stunners like Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de M√∫sica de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows). High-end shopping on the ritzy Passeig de Gracia is just a few blocks away, with Pla√ßa de Catalunya and the famous Las Ramblas located less than 20 minutes' walk from our building.;Local permit: HUTB-005259;Whatever it is you came to see in Barcelona, I'll bet it's within easy walking distance of the house. Sagrada Familia? 13 minutes. Passeig de Gracia shopping? Right around the corner. The Gothic Quarter? Psh, you can see it from the terrace! If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepci√≥ bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about ‚Ç¨45, or take the Aerobus to Pla√ßa Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience. You'll be provided all the necessary key codes in advance to make your check-in seamless.;I'm an Aussie who's lived in Barcelona for almost two decades.

You could call me a globetrotter - I‚Äôve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren‚Äôt just a place to lay your head...they‚Äôre your next home-away-from-home.

I bit about me.. After 4 years in Barcelona, I still enjoy living in this beautiful  city every day, I¬¥ve got lots left to explore and enjoy here. But that doesn¬¥t mean I don¬¥t like to change it for  a different scenery every once in a while. I am a big fan of travelling and little excursions. I started off here as a tour guide, and got to know many of the city¬¥s more hidden spots. Originally I am from the Netherlands where I studied in Utrecht, then lived in Madrid for a while before I decided I needed the sea closer to me. 

Languages Dutch English Spanish and (some) German are no problem for me.

The apartment is located in Palermo, the best neighborhood of Buenos Aires City.
I hope to help make your trip to Argentina a pleasant one. I was born and bred in Buenos Aires and am very familiar with most attractions and I can certainly offer assistance in procuring any kind of services
A little bit about me: I am a lawyer who loves to travel the world and live in different places. I have lived in places like Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Brussels and currently in Amsterdam. When I travel I like to walk a lot and discover the cities walking or biking. Maybe that's why I love Buenos Aires so much since you can do that very well here, and listen, my apartment is in the heart of the city so even if you don't like to walk so much, you have it all steps away!
Please feel free to contact me anytime If you have any question, I would be happy to answer to you.
I appreciate the AirBnB community!
